# Dog Breath Counter 🫀

A full-stack web application to count and monitor dog breathing rates, built with **TypeScript**, **Next.js**, and **Express**. **CI/CD** is implemented using **GitHub Actions**, with automated tests using **Vitest**, to ensure seamless deployment and code quality.

When a dog has or is at risk of developing a heart condition, monitoring their resting respiratory rate can be crucial. This app helps dog owners track their dog's breathing over time, detect early signs of heart disease, and share data with their veterinarian, ultimately helping to prevent the condition from worsening.

❤️ To all 🐕 lovers, and especially to those who, like me, are facing the anxiety of managing a beloved pet’s heart condition, this app is for you. ❤️

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. From the root directory, install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create `.env` files:

   For client:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```

   For server:

   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. From the root directory, run the development servers (one single command for both frontend and backend):

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start:

   - Frontend on http://localhost:3000
   - Backend on http://localhost:5000

## Available Scripts

- Run both frontend and backend: `npm run dev`

- Run frontend only: `npm run client`

- Run backend only: `npm run server`

- Run tests: `npm run test`

## Development Notes

### Current Setup

- Monorepo structure using npm workspaces
- TypeScript configuration for both client and server
- TailwindCSS setup with dark mode support
- Basic Express server configuration
- Environment configuration

## Testing Strategy

- **Frontend**: Unit tests for components and logic using Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Backend**: Unit and integration tests with Vitest + Supertest (to be decided)
- **E2E**: To be decided (possibly Cypress)
- **CI**: All tests run on pull requests via GitHub Actions

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Implemented:

- **Server side unit tests**: Run on every push and PR
- **Build process**: Both client and server are built in CI (Node 18, 20, and 22)

### Planned steps:

- **Code linting** – ESLint integration planned for both client and server
- **Type checking** – TypeScript check (`tsc --noEmit`) will be added to CI
- **Client side unit tests** – Tests to be added for the React frontend
- **Integration tests** – E2E with Cypress
- **Deployment** – Netlify or Vercel & Render
